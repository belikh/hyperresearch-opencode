# PORTING NOTES — hyperresearch (Claude Code) → hyperresearch-opencode

Running log of deliberate deltas from upstream
[jordan-gibbs/hyperresearch](https://github.com/jordan-gibbs/hyperresearch)
v0.10.0. Later pieces append here. Upstream attribution: Jordan Gibbs, MIT —
this port adapts that code under the same license.

## P0-2 — Scaffold

### requires-python: `">=3.11,<3.14"` → `">=3.11"`

Upstream capped below 3.14 because core dependency Crawl4AI pins
`lxml~=5.3`, which does not build on 3.14 (see upstream
`src/hyperresearch/cli/__init__.py`'s version-guard comment). With Crawl4AI
demoted to an optional extra (below), the blocker is gone and the harness
must run on the host's Python 3.14, so the cap is dropped entirely.
Classifiers gain `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.14`.

### Crawl4AI demoted from core dep to optional extra

Upstream ships Crawl4AI as a hard core dependency AND a `crawl4ai` extra;
here it is extra-only (`pip install hyperresearch[crawl4ai]`). opencode
replaces the browser-fetcher lane Crawl4AI served. Consequence documented on
the `all` extra:

- Upstream: `all = ["hyperresearch[crawl4ai,mcp,exa,tavily,watch]"]`
- Ours: `all = ["hyperresearch[mcp,exa,tavily,watch]"]` — crawl4ai excluded so
  `[all]` stays installable on Python 3.14; the browser lane is opt-in via the
  explicit `crawl4ai` extra.

All other floors are verbatim from upstream: typer>=0.9.0, rich>=13.0,
pyyaml>=6.0, pydantic>=2.0, jinja2>=3.1, platformdirs>=4.0, pymupdf>=1.24,
httpx>=0.27; extras mcp=["mcp>=1.6,<2"], exa=["exa-py>=2.0.0"],
tavily=["tavily-python>=0.3"], watch=["watchdog>=4.0"]; dev list unchanged
(already crawl4ai-free).

### Version: `0.10.0` → `0.10.0.post1`

PEP 440 post-release marking "port of 0.10.0 with deliberate deltas", so port
artifacts are distinguishable from upstream's while sorting after it.
`hyperresearch.__version__` mirrors this (enforced by `tests/test_scaffold.py`).

### mypy `python_version`: `"3.11"` → `"3.14"`

Installed mypy 2.3.1 accepts 3.14 as a check target, so strict mode checks
against the version we actually run. No fallback needed; no per-module
overrides were required for the skeleton (typer ships types). Later pieces add
overrides with comments only where third-party libs lack stubs.

### CLI scaffold deltas (upstream `cli/__init__.py`)

- Dropped the Python-version stderr warning guard: obsolete now that 3.14 is
  supported by design.
- Dropped the Windows cp1252 UTF-8 reconfigure shim: its stated reason was
  crash-safety for Crawl4AI's rich logger, which no longer exists in core.
- Entry-point contract preserved exactly: `hyperresearch` and `hpr` console
  scripts both point at `hyperresearch.cli:app`; `python -m hyperresearch`
  delegates through `__main__.py` like upstream. Scaffold app lives in
  `cli/main.py` (placeholder `--version/-V` eager callback mirroring
  upstream's), re-exported by `cli/__init__.py`; later pieces replace the
  assembly, not the contract.

### Ruff / pytest config

Mirrored verbatim: same select/ignore rule sets, same per-file-ignores entries
(including files not yet ported — globs simply don't match until later pieces
create them, and the policy travels with the config), line-length 100,
`src = ["src"]`. Kept `target-version = "py311"` to mirror upstream; ruff
0.16.4 accepts it. pytest ini_options identical: `testpaths = ["tests"]`,
`addopts = "-ra -q --strict-markers"`.

### Environment evidence (P0-2 install)

Host: Linux, Python 3.14.5 (only interpreter). Venv `.venv/` created with
`python3 -m venv`; `pip install -e ".[dev]"` succeeded first try, all wheels,
no source builds. Recorded versions:

| Tool      | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| python    | 3.14.5  |
| pip       | 26.1.1  |
| ruff      | 0.16.4  |
| mypy      | 2.3.1 (compiled) |
| pytest    | 9.1.1   |
| typer     | 0.27.1  |
| pymupdf   | 1.28.2  |

Spike S0-6 input: **pymupdf 1.28.2 installed as a prebuilt cp314 wheel and
imports cleanly on Python 3.14** (`import pymupdf` OK) — no build toolchain
needed. Also note mypy resolved to 2.x despite our floor of `mypy>=1.8`
(upstream floor kept verbatim); if later pieces hit mypy 2.x breaking changes,
tighten to an upper bound then.

## P0-3 — Spikes (S0-1, S0-2, S0-3, S0-4, S0-6) + toolchain policy alignment

Full method/transcripts/verdicts under `docs/spikes/`; raw command output
under `evidence/spikes/`. Summary of deliberate deltas each spike forces:

### S0-1 nested subagents: REFUTED → flat orchestration design

An opencode subagent has NO task tool (child session export shows zero tool
calls; it answers `NO_TASK_TOOL_AVAILABLE`). Level-1 delegation
(primary → subagent) works and returns child results faithfully
(`NESTED_OK` round-tripped through the `general` agent). Two consequences:

- Port orchestration depth is capped at primary → subagent; "researcher
  spawns fetcher" chains are flattened into sequential task calls from the
  primary session.
- Investigators call `hpr fetch-batch` directly; roster prompts carry a
  "## Degraded mode" clause describing direct calls.

Method correction recorded (F-METHOD): `opencode run --agent <subagent>` is
not drivable from the CLI — opencode falls back to the default build agent
with a warning. Subagents can only be exercised via a primary driver.

### S0-2 agents dir naming: CONFIRMED (both dirs load)

`.opencode/agent/<name>.md` AND `.opencode/agents/<name>.md` both appear in
one `opencode agent list`, merged with built-ins and global user agents.
Default mode renders `(all)` unless frontmatter restricts it, so port roster
agents set `mode: subagent` explicitly. A cold-init discovery miss was seen
once by the coordinator across ~5 fresh trees but not reproduced this
session — installers must re-run discovery after writing agent files and
treat first-run absence as retryable, never fatal.

### S0-3 tool-lock: CONFIRMED — belt-and-braces adopted

All three mechanisms produced REAL denials on live transcripts (not config
inspection): frontmatter `tools.write:false`, frontmatter `tools.edit:false`
(tool removed from toolset entirely), and a project plugin
`.opencode/plugins/denywrite.js` hooking `tool.execute.before` to throw on
`tool === "write"` (hard error in transcript even for UNLOCKED agents; hook
API taken from host-installed `@opencode-ai/plugin@1.17.13` types since no
working examples existed on this host). Patcher/polish-auditor ship BOTH
layers: frontmatter locks as layer 1, the deny plugin as backstop. Known
accepted gap: bash remains available under both mechanisms.

### S0-4 skill-load: CONFIRMED(static)-DYNAMIC-DEFERRED

Skills load from `<project>/.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (probe found at
its exact scratch path via `opencode debug skill`) and
`~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (7/7 global skills resolve
there). Dynamic freshness across steps is explicitly deferred to P3 E2E;
until then installed skills are write-once artifacts.

### S0-6 packaging: CONFIRMED (tiered), with metadata-trap finding

pymupdf 1.28.2 works end-to-end on 3.14 (render→extract round trip).
`.[all]` resolves without crawl4ai. Crawl4AI 0.7.3's dry run RESOLVES
(metadata-only false pass: lxml 5.4.0 sdist satisfies `~=5.3`), but a real
install FAILS building lxml on cpython-3.14 — upstream's blocker holds in
practice, so crawl4ai stays an opt-in ≤3.13 extra and opencode carries the
browser lane on the supported host. Rule recorded for later pieces: a pip
dry-run may only ever support a "metadata resolves" claim; installability
claims need a real install.

### mypy `python_version`: `"3.14"` → `"3.11"` (reverted)

P0-2 critic finding F3: single language-level policy — lint (ruff
`target-version = "py311"`) and type-check calibrate to the declared floor
3.11, while runtime correctness is proven by pytest on the host interpreter
3.14. Evidence: `evidence/gauntlet/P0-2-verdict-r1.md`. Post-fix gate green
in one pass: `.venv/bin/mypy src` → "Success: no issues found in 4 source
files"; `.venv/bin/ruff check .` → "All checks passed!"; `.venv/bin/pytest
-q` → exit 0 (1 passed). Raw outputs: `evidence/spikes/postfix-{mypy,ruff,
pytest}.txt`. This supersedes the P0-2 entry above that moved it to 3.14.
